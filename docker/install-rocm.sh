# rocm-hip-sdk is AMD's meta-package for "the HIP SDK" -- one name that tracks
# whatever AMD decides belongs in it (hipBLAS, hipSOLVER, hipFFT, hipRAND,
# hipSPARSE, rocm-smi, hipcc, rocm-cmake and the rest of the surface src/hip
# wraps).
#
# The five after it are the ones it does NOT pull, checked against its resolved
# dependency closure rather than assumed:
#   rocm-hip-runtime-dev  hipcc, rocm-llvm and lib/cmake/hip -- the HIP
#                   compiler itself. rocm-hip-sdk Depends on it at 7.0 and at
#                   7.2+, so naming it is a no-op there; the 7.1 SERIES DROPPED
#                   IT (verified in the apt index for both 7.1 and 7.1.1), and
#                   the omission surfaces only downstream, as CMake's
#                   "Failed to find ROCm root directory" when a HIP build
#                   calls enable_language(HIP). The floor image is 7.1, so this
#                   is load-bearing, not belt-and-braces -- and the tree needs
#                   hipcc regardless of what a meta-package decides to carry.
#   amd-smi-lib     the modern half of the nvml analogue (rocm-smi-lib, the
#                   older half, DOES come with the SDK via rocm-hip-libraries)
#   roctracer-dev   the cupti analogue
#   rocprofiler-sdk rocprofv3, its successor
#   rocm-gdb        parity with cuda-gdb

# --- ROCM_PRUNE: the compile-only variant -----------------------------------
#
# ROCm installs at ~20GB. A compile-only image can be built as a second tag
# (:hip-ci) with ROCM_PRUNE=1, which brings the image to 7.05GB; the dev image
# is untouched, since the default is off.
#
# IT IS AN OPTIMISATION, NOT AN ENABLER -- this comment used to claim a hosted
# runner has "20-25GB free" and that the prune was the only way the HIP job
# could fit. Measured upstream on a GitHub-hosted runner (145GB
# root with 86GB free BEFORE any cleanup, so the unpruned 20.5GB image would
# have fit comfortably. What the prune actually buys is ~13GB less to pull
# wherever the image is pulled, and a push that takes 3 minutes instead of many. Worth keeping
# for that, and worth not overstating.
#
# What comes out, measured rather than guessed (`du -x -d1 /opt/rocm/lib` plus
# `dpkg -S` on each of the largest files):
#
#   4.8G  composablekernel-dev   libdevice_{gemm,conv,reduction,contraction}
#                                _operations.a -- static archives nothing in
#                                this tree links. Pulled in by rocm-hip-sdk.
#   4.5G  hipblaslt/library      Tensile kernel objects, loaded at RUN time by
#   644M  rocblas/library        libhipblaslt.so / librocblas.so. The .so files
#   1.7G  rocfft/                themselves stay; only the kernel data goes.
#   459M  rocalution             sparse iterative solvers; nothing here wraps them
#
# ~12.1GB of ~20.5GB (it was ~12.3GB before hiptensor came off the list below),
# and none of it is a link-time dependency -- which is the
# test that decides what may go on this list. Adding anything here that a
# hipcc link actually needs surfaces as an undefined symbol in the ci-hip tier,
# not as a silent wrong answer, so the failure mode is at least loud.
#
# rccl (572M) used to be on this list -- "multi-GPU collectives; nothing here
# wraps them". wwr.hip.rccl now wraps it, so roc::rccl is a
# link-time dependency of the ci-hip build and rccl/rccl-dev must STAY: pruning
# it would fail find_package(rccl) at configure, exactly the loud failure the
# rule above describes. The figures above predate its retention and are now
# ~570MB larger for it.
#
# hiptensor (226M) left this list the same way and for the same reason: it was
# "tensor contraction; nothing here wraps them" until the cuTENSOR/hipTensor
# pair was wrapped, and it is the ONE half of that pair that costs this image
# nothing extra to keep -- rocm-hip-sdk already installs hiptensor-dev through
# rocm-hip-libraries, where the CUDA side had to add a package (see
# docker/install-cuda.sh). Pruning it now fails find_package(hiptensor).
#
# composablekernel-dev STAYS on the list even though hiptensor is built on CK:
# what comes out is CK's static archives, which hiptensor consumed when IT was
# compiled. Linking libhiptensor.so does not re-link them.
#
# Since ci-hip became a full build it also LINKS and LOADS the runtime test
# binaries, so the SuiteListIsComplete guards now dlopen librocblas,
# librocsolver, librocsparse and librocfft out of a pruned tree on every CI
# run. They pass: those libraries read their kernel data lazily, on handle
# creation, not at load. That is a stronger check of this list than the
# compile-time tier could make.
#
# THE DELETION HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS SCRIPT, not in a later Dockerfile layer.
# Layers are additive: an `rm` in a child layer hides the files but keeps their
# bytes in the parent, and the image does not shrink at all. That is also why
# :hip and :hip-ci cannot share the ROCm layer -- each is a full install.
#
# The whole packages go through apt rather than rm, so that removing one
# something else needs FAILS here instead of at link time. They pull out the
# rocm-hip-sdk / rocm-hip-libraries meta-packages with them, which carry no
# files of their own. --auto-remove is deliberately NOT passed: it would widen
# the removal to whatever else those metas were the last reference to, which is
# exactly the kind of quiet cascade this list is written to avoid. rccl/rccl-dev
# are deliberately NOT here anymore -- wwr.hip.rccl links roc::rccl (see the
# table above), and neither are hiptensor/hiptensor-dev.
