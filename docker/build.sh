# Build one of docker/Dockerfile.{base,cuda,hip,combined}, and everything it
# inherits from, in order.
#
#   docker/build.sh base          <PROJECT_NAME>:base
#   docker/build.sh cuda          base, then cuda   -> :cuda and :latest
#   docker/build.sh hip           base, then hip    -> :hip
#   docker/build.sh combined      base, cuda, then combined -> :combined
#
# Anything after the target is passed through to EVERY `docker build` in the
# chain, which is what you want for --no-cache, --progress=plain or --pull:
#
#   docker/build.sh cuda --no-cache
#
# Run it from anywhere; the build context is always the repo root, because the
# Dockerfiles spell their COPY and bind-mount paths relative to it.
#
# Three environment knobs turn a local build into a published one, used only by
# a registry publisher -- see "variant tags and the registry" below. NOTE there
# is no such workflow in this repo (no .github/ at all; docs/testing.md, "No
# CI, and the local gate"); these knobs are here for a human or a future one:
#
#   IMAGE_TAG_SUFFIX=-ci  IMAGE_REGISTRY=ghcr.io/owner  BUILD_PUSH=1 \
#     ROCM_PRUNE=1 docker/build.sh hip
#
# BUILD_DRY_RUN=1 prints every command, pushes included, and runs none of them.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
# The four Dockerfiles chain by TAG, not by stage (see Dockerfile.base, "WHY THE
# FOUR FILES CHAIN BY TAG"): a child's `FROM ${PARENT_IMAGE}` needs its parent
# already built and tagged, so something has to walk the chain in order. This is
# that something -- the single-Dockerfile `docker build --target cuda` that used
# to do it does not exist any more.
#
# It deliberately does NOT skip a step whose tag already exists. A cached
# `docker build` of an unchanged image is a second or two, and skipping on tag
# presence would silently hand a child a STALE parent after an edit to
# Dockerfile.base -- exactly the failure the single file could not have.

# that shares its Dockerfile -- same file, different build args, different tag.

# dev base someone has since rebuilt.
#
# `:latest` is DROPPED when a suffix is set. `nevpt2:latest-ci` would be a
# lie -- latest is the alias docker/compose.yaml resolves by default, and it
# must keep meaning the full CUDA dev image.
#
# Only the FINAL target is pushed, never its parents: a child image is
# self-contained (FROM copies the layers in), so publishing :base as well would
# upload 1.45GB that nothing pulls.
