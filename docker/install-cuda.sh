# Why apt and not the nvidia/cuda base image: this repo builds a HIP backend
# too, and the shared docker/Dockerfile.base cannot be both nvidia/cuda and
# rocm/dev-ubuntu at once. Installing the toolkit on top of plain Ubuntu is what
# lets `base` stay vendor-neutral. The nvidia/cuda images are themselves Ubuntu
# plus these same packages, so nothing is lost -- except the NVIDIA_* runtime
# env those images set, which Dockerfile.cuda sets explicitly instead.

#
# THE THREE AFTER IT ARE NOT IN THE TOOLKIT. Checked against the resolved
# closure of `cuda-toolkit-${CUDA_VERSION}`, which is compiler + libraries +
# tools + documentation + nvml and nothing else -- each of these ships as its
# own package from the SAME NVIDIA repo the keyring above registered, so they
# cost an apt name and no new source:
#
#   libnccl-dev       NCCL, multi-GPU collectives. wwr.cuda.nccl needs its
#                     nccl.h and libnccl.so -- the CUDA counterpart to ROCm's
#                     rccl, which IS in the base ROCm install. Unversioned so
#                     apt resolves the build matching the installed toolkit.
#                     See docker/install-rocm.sh for the HIP side.
#   cutensor-<major>  cuTENSOR, tensor contraction. Pairs with ROCm's hiptensor,
#                     which rocm-hip-sdk already installs. THE EXPENSIVE ONE:
#                     ~1.03GB installed (318MB runtime + 736MB dev at 2.8.1),
#                     Not linked by this project (WWR_WITH_TENSOR is OFF).
#   nvcomp-<major>    nvCOMP, GPU lossless compression. ~70MB. Not linked by
#                     this project (WWR_WITH_COMP is OFF), and its HIP
#                     counterpart (hipCOMP) is not packaged by AMD, so the HIP
#                     images go without.
#
# Why the `-cuda-<major>` suffix and not the bare `cutensor` / `nvcomp` metas:
# those are the CUDA-12-era names (`libcutensor-dev` still resolves to
# libcutensor2 2.2.0.0), while the suffixed metas track the toolkit generation
# installed here. The suffix is the MAJOR only -- `13`, not CUDA_VERSION's
# `13-0` spelling -- which is why it is derived rather than reused.

# libnccl-dev is a normal Debian library package: /usr/include/nccl.h and
# /usr/lib/<triplet>/libnccl.so, found by a bare `find_library`. The other two
# are not, and they are not even wrong in the same way -- each ships under its
# own package-named tree, so an unaided compile finds NEITHER header and the
# loader finds NEITHER runtime:
#
#   cuTENSOR   /usr/include/libcutensor/<major>/{cutensor.h,cutensor/types.h,…}
#              /usr/lib/<triplet>/libcutensor/<major>/libcutensor.so.2
#              and NO CMake config package at all -- find_path/find_library.
#   nvCOMP     /usr/include/libnvcomp<N>-dev-cuda-<major>/{nvcomp.h,nvcomp/…}
#              /usr/lib/<triplet>/libnvcomp<N>-dev-cuda-<major>/libnvcomp.so
#              -> ../libnvcomp<N>-cuda-<major>/libnvcomp.so.<N>  (the runtime)
#              and a real CMake config package, nvcomp-config.cmake.
#
# The `<N>` in nvCOMP's paths is the SONAME major, not the CUDA one, so those
# directory names change under a library bump that this file has no other
# reason to notice. Hence: DISCOVER the paths here, then publish them at fixed
# locations, rather than spelling today's names into Dockerfile.cuda's ENV
# where nothing would catch them going stale.
#
# The fixed shape is a /opt/nvidia/<lib>/{include,lib} prefix per library --
# what CMake already expects, so CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is all Dockerfile.cuda has
# to set, and `find_package(nvcomp)` / `find_path(cutensor.h)` both resolve
# with no per-library variable. Symlinks, not copies: the bytes stay in the apt
# tree that owns them, and `apt remove` still empties this out.
