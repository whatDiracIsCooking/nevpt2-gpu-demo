# remember you. Its OAuth session lives in $HOME/.claude/.credentials.json, so
# a $HOME/.claude that uid 1000 cannot write means `claude` asks you to log in,
# accepts the login, fails to save it, and asks again next time -- with no
# error anywhere that names the directory. That is exactly how this shipped:
# docker/Dockerfile.base's `install -d -o 1000 -g 1000 .../.claude/plugins`
# chowns only the leaf, leaving .claude itself root-owned.
#
# Two ways it is right now, and they are worth telling apart in the output:
# the devcontainers bind your HOST ~/.claude over it, so the login is simply
# the one you already have outside; a bare `docker run` of the image gets the
# image's own writable copy and one login that dies with the container.
