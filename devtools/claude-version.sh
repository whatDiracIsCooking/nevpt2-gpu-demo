# The report, and --rebuild after it rebuilds, also name every running
# container of this project still on a pre-bump image -- a container keeps
# the image it was created from, so rebuilding the image is not enough. It
# says how to recreate each one and never does it itself.
#
# The pin is `ARG CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=` in each file named by CLAUDE_PIN_FILES
# in devtools/config.sh -- the three GPU Dockerfiles, which each install
# docker/install-claude-code.sh as their last layer. That script's header has
# why the pin exists; this one keeps the copies in step, because a bump that
# reaches two files out of three is exactly the drift it was meant to end.
#
# Exit status: 0 when every file agrees with every other (and, for --apply,
# when the rewrite landed), 1 otherwise. Being BEHIND the registry is not a
# failure -- a pin is a deliberate choice of version, and this script's job is
# to make the gap visible, not to decide it.
#:
# Reading the registry needs the network. It is one unauthenticated GET of
# https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/latest with a short timeout; when it fails,
# the registry column reads `-` and everything else still works, which is what
# keeps doctor.sh usable on a box with no outbound route.

# --- the running containers -------------------------------------------------

# Which running containers of this project predate the image they came from.
#
# WHY: a bump lands in three places -- the Dockerfiles (--apply), the images
# (docker/build.sh, whose install-claude-code.sh fails the layer on a version
# mismatch, so a green build IS the check) and the running containers, which
# keep the image they were created from, by id, and so keep the pre-bump
# `claude`. Only the third is invisible from the host: after the 2.1.292 bump
# rebuilt all three images, the already-running `combined` container
# still answered 2.1.290. doctor.sh catches it from INSIDE a container;
# this is the host-side half.
#
# HOW: not by comparing image ids. `updateRemoteUserUID` makes the CLI build a
# `vsc-<basename>-<hash>-uid` image FROM `<PROJECT_NAME>:<variant>`, so a
# container's image id never equals the variant's, current or not. What does
# hold is that a derived image carries every layer of the image it was built
# from -- so a container is current exactly when the current
# `<PROJECT_NAME>:<variant>`'s TOP layer is among its own image's layers. A
# rebuilt variant has a new top layer, which no older container can carry.
#
# Containers are found by the `devcontainer.project` label every
# docker/Dockerfile.* stamps (a container inherits its image's labels), so this
# covers every worktree's containers, not just this checkout's; the variant is
# the directory of their `devcontainer.config_file` label, as in
# devcontainer.sh. The version shown is the container's own CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION
# ENV, read with `docker inspect` -- nothing execs into anything.
#
# REPORT ONLY: it never recreates a container, since someone may be working in
# it. Silent when docker is absent or its daemon is down -- which is the inside
# of every container, where doctor.sh has this covered.
