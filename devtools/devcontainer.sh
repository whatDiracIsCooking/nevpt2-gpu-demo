#   devtools/devcontainer.sh shell       open a bash shell inside

#   devtools/devcontainer.sh down --all  ... every GPU variant of this worktree
#
# WHICH VARIANT: a flag BEFORE the command, naming a directory under
# .devcontainer/ -- so this repo's three configs are reachable as:
#
#   devtools/devcontainer.sh --hip shell        .devcontainer/hip/
#   devtools/devcontainer.sh --combined up      .devcontainer/combined/
#   devtools/devcontainer.sh --cuda rebuild     .devcontainer/cuda/ (the default)
#
# The flag must come before the command, because everything after `shell` and
# `test` is passed through to what runs inside. Use it on EVERY call in a
# session, teardown included -- `down` matches on the config file, so
# `--hip up` followed by a bare `down` takes down the CUDA container and leaves
# the HIP one running. `down --all` is the escape hatch.
#
# CPUSET / CPUS (from config.sh, or set for one call) bound the container's
# share of the host on `up` and `rebuild`:
#
#   CPUSET=0-11 devtools/devcontainer.sh up      pin to host cores 0-11
#   CPUS=8      devtools/devcontainer.sh up      cap at 8 cores' worth
#
# Unlike JOBS, which only bounds the test runner, these bound everything the
# container runs -- compiles started from a `shell` included.
#
# The three configs, and what each is:
#
#   .devcontainer/cuda/devcontainer.json      CUDA 13 (the default)
#   .devcontainer/hip/devcontainer.json       ROCm, no CUDA at all
#   .devcontainer/combined/devcontainer.json  both SDKs, ~40GB
#
# Three ways to choose, highest precedence first: the flag above, the
# DEVCONTAINER_CONFIG environment variable, and its default in config.sh (the
# CUDA variant -- the one that can actually build the C++ tree). The variable
# is still the way to point at a config that is not one of these, and the way
# to make a whole shell session use one:
#
#   export DEVCONTAINER_CONFIG=.devcontainer/hip/devcontainer.json
#
# Containers key on the workspace folder path AND the config file, so each
# worktree gets its own container per variant, and the variants of one worktree
# can be up at the same time. They SHARE that worktree's named volumes (see the
# comment in the json), so run the suite in one variant at a time. The script
# resolves the workspace from its own location, so it does the right thing
# whichever checkout you call it from, and from any cwd.
#
# IMAGES do not key on the config file, and that asymmetry surprises people:
# the CLI names a built image `vsc-<workspace basename>-<sha256 of the
# workspace PATH>`, so all three variants of one checkout build to that ONE
# name and each `up` retags it away from the last. The containers are
# unharmed -- each holds its image by id -- but the variant that lost the tag
# goes untagged and unexplainable in `docker images`, so `up` and `rebuild`
# add a `:<variant>` tag beside the CLI's `:latest`. See tag_variant_image.
#
# Project-specific values (the test command, the worker count) come from
# devtools/config.sh -- edit that, not this.

# The container's git IDENTITY -- a different problem from the git DIR above,

# The bind makes the repo visible in there and docker/Dockerfile.base's
# /etc/gitconfig makes a push authenticate, but neither supplies a name and an
# email, so the first commit inside died with "Author identity unknown" after
# the work was already staged. This resolves YOUR identity here, on the host,
# and exports it for the `${localEnv:...}` lookups in
# .devcontainer/*/devcontainer.json; .devcontainer/git-identity.sh is what
# applies it inside, from postCreateCommand.
#
# `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT`, NOT `git config --get user.name`, and that is
# MEASURED on this box rather than a style preference: ~/.gitconfig here sets
# user.email and no user.name at all, yet host commits are authored correctly,
# because git falls back to the GECOS field of /etc/passwd. `git config --get
# user.name` returns empty for such a host, so it would have exported half an
# identity and left the container exactly as broken. `git var` is git's own
# resolution of the ident it would really use, GECOS fallback included, and it
# exits 128 with "Author identity unknown" when there is genuinely none -- so
# the exit status below is the test, and stderr is dropped because that message
# is reworded in the warning.
#
# The container cannot do this resolution for itself. Its `ubuntu` user has the
# GECOS field "Ubuntu", so git in there auto-detects a NAME and then fails on
# the email -- MEASURED in nevpt2:cuda:
#
#   fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'ubuntu@49011452b048.(none)')
#
# which is why BOTH halves are carried in. Pass only the email and commits
# succeed, attributed to "Ubuntu".
#
# WHY THEY GO IN UNDER NEVPT2_* NAMES rather than straight into the container as
# GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: an unset host value reaches containerEnv as
# an EMPTY STRING, the same trap GH_TOKEN has, and an empty GIT_AUTHOR_NAME is
# strictly worse than an absent one. MEASURED:
#
#   nothing set anywhere  -> "Author identity unknown", which one
#                            `git config --global` inside the container fixes
#   GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=""    -> "fatal: empty ident name (for <>) not allowed",

#                            config, so there is no fixing it from inside

# Tag the image this variant just built with the variant's name.
#
# WHY: the CLI derives a built image's name from the workspace folder ALONE --
# `vsc-<basename>-<sha256 of the path>`, with the config file nowhere in it --
# while it keys the CONTAINER on both. So the three variants of one checkout
# share a single image name, and every `up` retags it away from whichever
# variant built it last, leaving that one's image untagged: still on disk,
# still held by its container, and no longer attributable in `docker images`.
# There is no `--image-name` on `up` to head that off -- the CLI offers that
# flag on `build` only -- so the tag goes on afterwards.
#
# It is a SECOND tag on the SAME repository, deliberately: `vsc-<...>:cuda`
# beside the CLI's `vsc-<...>:latest`, not a name of our own. worktree.sh's
# `rm` and `gc` recognise this project's build images by that
# `vsc-<basename>-<64hex>` repository and delete by image id, so they keep
# sweeping these with no edit there; a parallel naming scheme would leak past
# both.
#
# Non-fatal throughout, like apply_cpu_limits: `up` has already done its work
# by this point, and a missing tag costs legibility rather than a container.

#
# WHY HERE: `up` and `rebuild` are the only moments the version in the
# container can change, and the failure this guards against is a SILENT one --
# the agent in the image used to come from a devcontainer feature that
# npm-installed an unpinned version into a permanently cached layer, so every
# rebuild reported success and moved nothing (docker/install-claude-code.sh
# has the measurements). Now that the pin is a line in git, the only thing
# left to notice is that the line is old, and nothing else would.
#
# Quiet when there is nothing to say, non-fatal always -- the container is
# already up by this point, and a registry that cannot be reached is not a
# reason to colour the run red. The timeout is short for the same reason: this
# is on the path of every `up`.

# The CLI prints the whole `docker run` invocation on failure, GH_TOKEN and
# all. Everything below routes through this so a secret cannot reach the
# terminal; the exit status is the CLI's, not sed's.
#
# `sed -u` is load-bearing, not a micro-optimisation. sed's own stdout is the
# terminal, so without it sed is LINE-buffered: anything not terminated by a
# newline is held indefinitely. That silently swallows every partial-line
# write the CLI passes through -- pytest's progress dots, a compiler's
# carriage-returned status, and (before `shell` stopped routing through here)
# the shell prompt itself. GNU sed only; the images and the host are both
# Ubuntu.
#
# The CLI's exit is the end of its output, NOT EOF on the filters' pipes.
# When `up`/`rebuild` creates a container, the CLI's
# `docker run -a STDOUT -a STDERR` stays attached for the container's whole
# life, holding inherited write ends of both pipes -- so the seds never see
# EOF, and they hold the CALLER's stdout/stderr open with them: `... | cat`,
# `$(...)` or an agent capturing output then blocks until the container
# stops. (The old bare `wait` did not even wait for them; the script exited
# and left two seds resident per container.) So: drop our write ends, give
# the filters a bounded grace to drain what the CLI wrote and exit on EOF --
# which they do at once whenever nothing else holds the pipes -- then stop
# any still running. Nothing is lost by stopping them: the CLI has exited,
# sed -u has written out every line it read, and the docker run holding the
# pipe only relays the container's own startup chatter. The docker run itself
# is not touched (--sig-proxy=false; the container keeps running).
