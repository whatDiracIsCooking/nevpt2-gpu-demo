# Compile the tree for the backend you are NOT building, to catch the class of
# bug that a green build on one backend cannot see.
#
#   devtools/cross-backend-check.sh [--fresh] [-j N] [--native] [--device-only]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A build targets exactly one backend, and the two are
# compiled by different front ends: a .cu goes through nvcc under CUDA and
# through clang's `-x hip` under HIP. nvcc is the more permissive of the two,
# so code that only clang rejects compiles clean, passes ctest, and ships --
# and the first sign of trouble is a ROCm build weeks later.
#
# A concrete example of the class: a functor that carries a `const` member of
# CLASS type is non-trivially-copyable under clang, so it fails the
# front end rejects -- yet nvcc accepts it.
# Such code compiles clean, stays green across the whole CUDA tier, and only
# fails when someone builds ROCm. Here the risk is sharper still: src/ is one
# tree compiled for both, so a raw vendor call slipped in outside
# src/cublas/cublas_emul.cpp (CUDA-only by design) breaks only the
# backend you did not build.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. This is a COMPILE-ONLY check -- no runtime
# tests, no device -- which is why it is worth running every time where
# devtools/cpp-tier.sh costs minutes. NO TIMINGS ARE QUOTED HERE ON PURPOSE:
# this tree is small (a dozen TUs plus the kernel compiles), so the cost
# tracks the dependency and a number measured today would be stale by the next
# submodule bump. Measure it on your box if you need one.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It proves the other backend COMPILES, not that it runs:
# no kernel is launched and no result is checked. A real ROCm box running
# `devtools/cpp-tier.sh --preset hip` is still the stronger statement, and is
# what you want before trusting the backend in anger. This is the cheap check
# you can afford every time.
#
# Flags:
#   --fresh         wipe the CMake cache first. Needed after changing a
#                   toolchain variable, which a plain reconfigure keeps.
#   -j N            parallel compile jobs (default: BUILD_JOBS from
#                   devtools/config.sh, or Ninja's own choice when empty).
#   --device-only   build only the kernel device libraries instead of the
#                   whole compile-time tier. Narrower: it catches a kernel-side
#                   divergence but not one in a module unit, and it only knows
#                   the targets CROSS_CHECK_DEVICE_TARGETS names (default:
#                   nevpt2_device_libraries, the umbrella every *.device
#                   library joins). Empty, and this
#                   flag refuses rather than building nothing and calling it a
#                   pass.
#   --native        skip the container and run cmake here. Implied when this
#                   host already has the target backend's toolchain.
#
# Exit status: 0 the other backend compiles, 1 it does not, 2 the check could
# not be run at all (no toolchain and no usable image) -- never a silent skip,
# because the machines least likely to have ROCm are exactly the ones where
# this is worth knowing.
#: -- help stops here --
#
# Deliberately NOT a git hook. It needs docker and a ~20GB image, so on a host
# without them it can only skip -- and a gate that silently does nothing on the
# machine that most needs it is worse than no gate, which is the same reasoning
# .pre-commit-config.yaml gives for keeping the C++ tier off the push gate.
# Run it before opening a PR that touches a .cu, or anything under src/ that a
# .cu includes.
#
# Deliberately NOT devcontainer.sh --hip either: that brings up a full
# devcontainer with its own volumes and per-worktree state, which is the right
# tool for working IN the HIP backend and far too much machinery for a
# four-second compile.
