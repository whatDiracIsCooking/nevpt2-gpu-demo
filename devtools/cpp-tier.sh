# Configure, build and ctest the C++ tree -- the ONLY tier that proves src/

# suite beside it and no install tier; every golden ctest entry is labelled
# `gpu`, so this needs a real card, and a green `-LE gpu` run proves only the
# host-only GoogleTest suites (test/) -- logic, never an energy. It runs
# devtools/stream-lint.sh --strict first (a gate), and
# devtools/throw-lint.sh (no `throw` in src/ or apps/).

#
# It is NOT on the push gate: a C++23
# named-module build with CUDA separable compilation costs minutes even warm,
# and a gate that costs minutes is one people learn to bypass with --no-verify.
# Run it yourself, on a box with a card, before opening a PR. There is no CI
# to run it for you, on purpose (docs/testing.md, "No CI, and the local gate"): a
# hosted runner has no GPU, and every ctest entry here needs one.
#
# THE TOOLCHAIN IS NOT ON YOUR HOST. clang-20 with libc++'s module manifest,
# CMake 4.2 and nvcc live in docker/Dockerfile.cuda, so the normal way to call
# this is from inside that container (which DEVCONTAINER_CONFIG in config.sh
# already selects):
#
#   devtools/devcontainer.sh shell -c devtools/cpp-tier.sh
#
# On a bare host with its own clang and CUDA, use --preset workstation. The two
# presets are the same configuration and differ only in binaryDir -- nothing is
# expected prebuilt anywhere (the one fetch, GoogleTest, lands in each build
# dir's own _deps/), so the point is simply that a host build and a container build get separate
# build directories instead of reconfiguring each other's.
# `devtools/doctor.sh` lists which of the two situations you are in.
#
# Flags:
#   --preset NAME   configure/build preset (default: CMAKE_PRESET from
#                   devtools/config.sh). The test preset follows it when one of
#                   the same name exists, and is skipped with a note when not
#                   -- see `ctest --list-presets` (the ci-* presets have
#                   none). This is how the sanitizer tier runs:
#                   --preset asan | ubsan | compute-sanitizer on the CUDA card,
#                   hip-asan | hip-ubsan on the AMD one, each configuring,
#                   building and testing its own build-<preset>/ (the small
#                   CAS(4,4)/CAS(8,8) entries plus that sanitizer's canaries).
#                   The compute-sanitizer tool is a cache variable, so pick a
#                   non-default one by configuring first:
#                     cmake --preset compute-sanitizer \
#                       -DNEVPT2_COMPUTE_SANITIZER_TOOL=initcheck
#                     devtools/cpp-tier.sh --preset compute-sanitizer
#   --fresh         wipe the CMake cache first (`--fresh`). Needed after
#                   changing a toolchain variable; a plain reconfigure keeps
#                   the old value and the change appears to do nothing.
#   --clean         rebuild every object (`--clean-first`), keeping the cache.
#   --no-test       configure and build only.
#   --tidy          after a successful build, run clang-tidy over the .cpp
#                   implementation units using the build's
#                   compile_commands.json. Reports findings; does NOT fail
#                   the run, because the tree is not clean yet (see
#                   .clang-tidy). Off by default so the normal tier stays
#                   a build-and-test.
#   --rocm          run the HIP preset against a REAL AMD GPU, from the HOST.
#                   Re-execs this script inside ROCM_IMAGE with /dev/kfd,
#                   /dev/dri and the NUMERIC host render/video gids passed
#                   through (config.sh's ROCM_* settings say why numeric).
#                   Implies --preset hip unless --preset says otherwise.
#                   Every other flag is forwarded. Exits 2 rather than 0 when
#                   it cannot run, so a skip is never read as a pass.
#                   cross-backend-check.sh proves the other backend COMPILES;
#                   this proves it RUNS, and needs a card to say so.
#   -j N            parallel compile jobs (default: BUILD_JOBS from config.sh,
#                   or Ninja's own choice when that is empty). Module builds
#                   are memory-hungry per job -- a too-high N OOMs rather than
#                   failing cleanly.
#   --report DIR    timestamped log + one-line summary (default:
#                   SLOW_TIER_REPORTS from config.sh).
#   -- <args>       everything after `--` is passed to ctest verbatim
#                   (e.g. `-- -R Constants` to scope the run). ctest has
#                   one entry per golden case, so -R matches names like
#                   nevpt2_cas1010 / nevpt2_cas1212 / nevpt2_cas1010_cublas.
#
# Exit status is the first failing phase's, so a scheduler can alert on it.
#: -- help stops here --
#
# Deliberately NOT what docker/compose.yaml's `build`/`test` services do, even
# though the commands overlap: compose owns the batch path (it brings its own
# container, tees to .log/, for an unattended run), this owns the
# already-inside-a-container path. Changing the preset list means touching
# CMakePresets.json, which both read -- neither hardcodes one.
